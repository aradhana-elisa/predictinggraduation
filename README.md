# Predicting Graduation rates for Freshmen to graduate in 4,5 or 6 years
Business, financial aspects, government, and science are turning to predictive analytics to deal with issues. For instance, anticipating what will happen later thinking about the past event, better understanding customers and giving them what they require is basic as it can uncover new patterns. Each pattern can show an organization needs an approach to foresee results, e.g., the expected rates of the undergraduates in view of the qualities from the previous years, to roll out improvements and enhance in connection to removed outcomes. Fresno State has a comparable test, which is the reason for this undertaking. The point of this venture is to foresee the graduation rates of the students, how likely they will graduate within 4, 5, or 6 years. The initial step of the exploration was to examine various features, machine learning techniques, and gather the information from various sources. Machine learning algorithms, such as Logistic Regression, K Nearest Neighbor (KNN), Decision Trees, and Random Forest Decision Trees were evaluated for obtaining the closest conceivable expectations. The outcomes from each model were shown in a confusion matrix and were broken down by the precision, recall, F-measure, and AUC(Area Under the Curve).
